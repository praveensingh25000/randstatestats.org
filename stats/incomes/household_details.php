			<li style="padding-top:5px;">1979 data reflect implementation of 1980 census population controls; the questionnaire was expanded to show 27 possible values from 51 possible sources of income</li>
			<li style="padding-top:5px;">1983 data reflect implementation of Hispanic population weighting controls and introduction of 1980 census-based sample design</li>

			<li style="padding-top:5px;">Starting in 1999, 50th percentile is based on micro-sorted data</li>
			<li style="padding-top:5px;">1999 data reflect the implementation of Census 2000-based population controls</li>
			<li style="padding-top:5px;">2000 data reflect the implementation of a 28,000 household sample expansion</li>

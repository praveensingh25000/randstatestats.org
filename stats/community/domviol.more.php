Data Limitations and Information provided by the California Department of Justice.
</h2>


<p>
The Domestic Violence File contains records of domestic violence-related
calls reported by law enforcement agencies to the Department of Justice's
Criminal Justice Statistics Center (CJSC).  The form (CJSC 715) requests
monthly reports on the total number of domestic violence-related calls for
assistance, total cases in which weapons were involved, and the type of
weapon if known.  The following information and limitations should be
considered when interpreting and using the Domestic Violence data.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
California law enforcement agencies started reporting Domestic
Violence-related Calls to the Department in 1986, in compliance with Penal
Code Section 13730.  Data collection began in July 1986, therefore, only
six month of data are available for 1986.
<br>
<br>
<li>
The data reported on the CJSC 715 form is recorded just as it is
reported to the Department by local law enforcement agencies.  Agencies
report total number of domestic violence-related calls that are received
and verified.
<br>
<li>
Penal Code 13700(a) defines domestic violence as "'Abuse' intentionally or
recklessly causing or attempting to cause bodily injury, or placing
another person in reasonable apprehension of imminent serious bodily
injury to himself or herself, or another."
<br>
<br>
<li>
The Penal Code 13700(b) definition of "'Domestic Violence' is abuse
committed against an adult or fully emancipated minor who is a spouse,
former spouse, cohabitant, former cohabitant, or person with whom the
suspect has had a child or is having or has had a dating or engagement
relationship...'cohabitant' means two unrelated adult persons living
together for a substantial period of time, resulting in some permanency of
relationship.  Factors that may determine whether persons are cohabiting
include, but are not limited to, (1) sexual relations between the parties
while sharing the same living quarters, (2) sharing of income or expenses,
(3) joint use or ownership of property, (4) whether the parties hold
themselves out as husband and wife, (5) the continuity of the
relationship, and (6) the length of the relationship."
<br>
<br>
<li>
The definition of "domestic violence" is interpreted differently by the
various law enforcement agencies reporting data to CJSC.  As a result,
different types of relationships may be included in the database.  In
addition to violence between heterosexual adults involved in a dating
relationship, the data may or may not include violence between adults
involved in homosexual relationships, violence between platonic roommates,
in-laws, or violence between any family member.  The CJSC remains
committed to clarifying the desired interpretation at every available
opportunity.
<br>
<br>
<li>
Included in the data are any cases which resulted in a report being
written by the responding law enforcement agencies.  The data, therefore,
includes both cases where an arrest was made, and those where
circumstances did not warrant an arrest.
<br>
<br>
<li>
The San Francisco Police Department was unable to provide complete data
for 1997, and did not report data for calendar year 1998 or 1999, due to
computer problems.  The Hanford Police Department, Lemoore Police
Department and the Upland Police Department did not provide complete data
for 2009.
</ul>

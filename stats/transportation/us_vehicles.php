			<li style="padding-top:5px;">Surface vehicle data for 2007-10 were calculated using a new methodology developed by FHWA. Data for these years are based on new categories and are not comparable to previous years. The new category Light duty vehicle, short wheel base replaces the old category Passenger car and includes passenger cars, light trucks, vans and sport utility vehicles with a wheelbase (WB) equal to or less than 121 inches. The new category Light duty vehicle, long wheel base replaces Other 2-axle, 4-tire vehicle and includes large passenger cars, vans, pickup trucks, and sport/utility vehicles with wheelbases (WB) larger than 121 inches.

Bus service is a variety of roadway services that share the characteristic of being entirely or partially fixed routes. Bus service includes local service, express service, subscription service, diversionary route service, loop service, and other types. Although Bus service is normally provided by buses, it can be provided by smaller vehicles that may be considered large vans.</li>

	<h2>RAND California Occupational Projections Background</h2><br/>

		<p>These occupational projections show the estimated number of
		jobs by occupation for most California MSAs and several
		regions for the years 2002-2012 and 2004-2014.
		The number of jobs for 2002 and 2004 are actual. They also
		return average annual growth (in number of jobs)
		and the average annual growth rate (in percent).
		 The number of jobs due to permanent separations is
		defined as an estimate of the number of people expected to leave
		the occupation permanently. Individuals may leave for another
		occupation, leave the occupation due to retirement or for
		personal reasons. However, these jobs need to be replaced by
		workers new to the occupation.</p><br/>

		<p>Regional consortia are defined as follows: </p><br/>

	<!-- <h2>Nonimmigrant Admissions (I-94), Footnotes</h2> --><br/>

		<p>
		An I-94 is a form denoting the Arrival-Departure Record of particular
		foreigners used by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).
		Admissions represent counts of events, i.e., arrivals, not unique individuals; multiple
		entries of an individual on the same day are counted as one admission.
		The majority of short-term admissions from Canada and Mexico are excluded.

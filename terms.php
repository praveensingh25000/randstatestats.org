<p style="text-align:justify"><b>3. Proprietary Rights of RAND. </b></p>&nbsp;

<p>All right, title and interest in RAND State Statistics and the

distribution and publication of your information. However, RAND
reserves the right to take any actions that RAND deems necessary
or desirable, including without limitation immediately
terminating your access rights to RAND State Statistics, if RAND
believes that your content or materials or use of RAND

services of others, exceeds any of the limitations in this
paragraph 4. Such actions include but are not limited to
terminating your service. </p>&nbsp;

with, surreptitiously intercept or expropriate any system, data
or personal information. You may not distribute or allow anyone
else to distribute unsolicited commercial e-mail

any other action that imposes an unreasonable or
disproportionately large load on our infrastructure, or engage in
(&ldquo;Ponzi&rdquo;) or pyramid schemes. </p>&nbsp;

activity, if they request it. We will store only such information
and the user's RAND State Statistics account name. </p>&nbsp;

<p style="text-align:justify">We may use the information we collect from visitors to our Web
site to improve the content of our Web site, to customize the
content and layout of our pages for each individual visitor, to
administer our Web site, to analyze trends, and to notify
visitors about updates to our Web site. </p>&nbsp;

<p style="text-align:justify">We do not wish to obtain personally identifiable information
from children who are using our site unsupervised. Thus, we ask
children to obtain the consent of their parent or guardian before
providing us with any personally identifiable information. </p>&nbsp;

<p style="text-align:justify"><u>Disclosure of Information:</u> We do not share with other
organizations any information we obtain from visitors. </p>&nbsp;

<p style="text-align:justify"><u>Links and Third party sites:</u> This policy only addresses
our activities from our servers. Other sites (including those
that we link to by a reference or within an advertisement banner
or otherwise) may have their own policies, which we do not
control, and thus are not addressed by this policy. Links that we
provide to sites of third parties sites are only made by us with
their approval. </p>&nbsp;

<p style="text-align:justify"><u>Review and Removal of Your Personally Identifiable Data.</u>
If you provide us with personally identifiable information to
have us perform ongoing services to you, we will take reasonable
steps to provide you with a way to review the information we have

the extent that such information is also stored in other
